# ⚠️ Dataset Release Update (February 2026)
Status: Delayed / Under Ethical Review

We previously aimed to release the dataset by December, but the release has been delayed. While we are eager to share this data with the community, it is currently undergoing a mandatory ethical, privacy, and legal review to ensure full compliance with data protection standards.

We will release the dataset immediately once this process is finalized.

<u>**Contact for Review Progress: The review process is currently being supervised by Dr. Yotsu Rie. If you require information regarding the progress or timeline of this review, please contact her directly at ryotsu@tulane.edu.**</u>

Thank you for your patience.
